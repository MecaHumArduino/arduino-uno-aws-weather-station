# Weather Station with Arduino Uno board, DHT11 Sensor, LCD screen and AWS IOT

This tutorial shows you how to use the [DHT11](https://amzn.to/2Qs9fcV) temperature and humidity sensors with the [Arduino Uno](https://amzn.to/2RnHhPY) board to build a simple weather station that displays current temperature and humidity on an [LCD](https://amzn.to/2FzJdT6) screen and pushes the data to AWS IoT through an [ESP8266](https://amzn.to/3hqqWom) board.

In the **first part**, we'll go through a quick introduction to the sensor, pinout, wiring diagram, and finally the Arduino sketch.

In the **second part**, WIP...

What is humidity?
-----------------
Humidity is the water vapor around you mixed with air. It is measured in %. So, if the humidity is 60%, then 60% of the air around you is water vapor. If it is 100%, then it means either the sensor is not correct, the sensor is broken/damaged, the Arduino crashed, the Arduino can't receive any signal, there's an error in the code or you're underwater(1). If it's 0%, it means all the reasons above except the last one, you're in space or you're in the middle of a desert(2).

(1) Correction: it means the air cannot hold any more water.<br><br>

(2) The air in a desert does contain some water but it is a very little amount compared to a normal place. The Sahara Desert has a mean humidity of 25%.</p>


How to measure Temperature & Humidity

This is a [DHT11](https://amzn.to/2Qs9fcV) sensor, it is a temperature and humidity combined sensor with calibrated digital signal output. It's is a reliable sensor for determining temperature and humidity. There is a newer and more accurate module on the market called DHT22 but we will stick with the DHT11 for this demo

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

Wire the [DHT11](https://amzn.to/2Qs9fcV) or [DHT22](https://amzn.to/31t7P8l) sensor to the [Arduino Uno](https://amzn.to/2RnHhPY) development board as shown in the following schematic diagram.
